*Love at First View*

## About
Many people turn to technology, especially dating apps, to find romantic interests in their lives. 
One telling sign two people will get along is their interests. However, many people will lie about their hobbies in order to attract someone specific, leading to toxic relationships.

But, no one is lying about their search history!! Youtube is a great way to watch videos about things you love, and similar Youtube watch histories could be the start of a romantic love story ðŸ’—

So, we created MatchTube--the ultimate Tinder x Youtube crossover. Find matches based on your Youtube watch history and see your love life finally go somewhere!
